                Not everyone can enjoy the warm, sunny months of the year.
                <br/><br/>
                Millions of dog owners find themselves drowning in guilt…
                <br/><br/>
                Knowing that their lovely pup must face an endless battle against an invisible enemy...
                <br/><br/>
                Scratching themselves raw, losing their beautiful fur like they were bitten by a thousand mosquitos…
                <br/><br/>
                With their tails sadly tucked in, they pause every few steps to sit down, trying desperately to scratch away the irritation...
                <br/><br/>
                And the happy and playful pup you once knew and loved is lost, replaced by a fur baby struggling just to get through the day.
                <br/><br/>
                And that breaks your heart.
                <br/><br/>
                You endure sleepless nights, kept awake by the chalkboard scratching sounds of your pup's constant itching…
                <br/><br/>
                The harrowing sight of their raw, red, inflamed skin haunts you, knowing that each scratch only intensifies their pain…
                <br/><br/>
                And the exhausting merry-go-round cycle continues, as you try countless remedies that just don’t seem to work.

                In a moment I’ll share with you an emotional story of how this <span class="font-weight-bold">Newborn Nectar</span> helped Marco – a 70-pound German Shepherd – alleviate his unbearable itching and scratching…
                <br/><br/>
                Transforming him back into the happy, playful pup he once was.
                <br/><br/>
                All Marco’s owners had to do was follow a simple <span class="font-weight-bold">15-second after-meal ritual…</span>
                Which forced a <span class="font-weight-bold">'reset'</span> on his immune system, enabling it to combat the root cause of his itching and scratching.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-center m-auto py-4 m-auto"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://img.funnelish.com/15696/294304/1709143094-dog%20113.svg" /></div>
        <div>
            <p>
                No more raw, inflamed skin.
                    <br/><br/>
                    No more suffering.
                    <br/><br/>
                    And no more burden of guilt for his family.
                    <br/><br/>
                    You see, unlike traditional solutions…
                    <br/><br/>
                    Like oatmeal baths... prescription meds... or sprays that only provide temporary relief or address the symptoms...
                    <br/><br/>
                    This <span class="font-weight-bold">Newborn Nectar</span> goes straight to your pup's natural defense system and fights against these allergic reactions from the inside out.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In just a minute I’ll explain the root cause of your dog's itchiness… 
                    <br/><br/>
                    And how this <span class="font-weight-bold">Newborn Nectar</span> could be the missing piece to the puzzle. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    You might be thinking…

                More on that shortly though.
                <br/><br/>

                    <br/><br/>
                    But what might surprise you is that I was never really interested in dogs growing up.
                    <br/><br/>
                    And the reason is simple.
                    <br/><br/>
                    As a child, I suffered from severe allergies to most pets, including dogs.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Yet, fate had other plans for me.
                    <br/><br/>
                    It was after marrying my dog-loving wife that we decided to adopt a furkid before having children of our own.

            And with every day I grew closer to Splash…

                But here I am, the founder of iHeartDogs… 
                <br/><br/>
                A company dedicated to educating & improving the lives of dogs and their owners.
                <br/><br/>
                After adopting Splash, I began to immerse myself in the world of dogs.
                <br/><br/>
                I read everything I could about dog behavior, training, and nutrition.
                <br/><br/>
                I wanted to understand <span class="text-decoration-underline">everything</span> about how to keep him healthy and happy.
                <br/><br/>
                I also started volunteering at local animal shelters… 
                <br/><br/>
                Which gave me a firsthand look at the challenges facing dogs who didn't have loving homes… 
                <br/><br/>
                As I learned more about dog nutrition… 
                <br/><br/>
                I became increasingly interested in the role of supplements in supporting their health… 
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="font-weight-bold">I wanted to create products that would help dogs live their best lives, and that's exactly what I did.</span>
                <br/><br/>
                I partnered with veterinarians and nutritionists to create supplements that were made with high-quality ingredients backed by science.
                <br/><br/>
                But I didn't stop there.
                <br/><br/>
                I wanted to know for sure that our supplements were effective, so I set up a lab where we could test them.
                <br/><br/>
                We conducted clinical trials to ensure that our supplements were safe and effective for dogs of all ages and breeds.

        <div >
            <p>
                One day, I visited my good friend Richard who also had adopted a puppy a few months ago.
                <br/><br/>
                That was the first time I met their 9-month-old German Shepherd named Marco.
            </p>

                </div>
                <p>
                A gorgeous, friendly, and playful dog that was the perfect companion for Richard’s three young kids.
                <br/><br/>
                The family didn’t know much about dogs, but they needed a big guard dog for their 100,000+ square feet property.
                <br/><br/>
                That’s when they welcomed Marco into their home.
                <br/><br/>
                But, as Spring arrived, things took a terrible turn.
                <br/><br/>
                Marco began to scratch himself excessively…
                <br/><br/>
                Leaving him uneasy, irritated, and in constant discomfort.
                <br/><br/>
                His body was covered with red welts and hot spots, and his fur started to fall out.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-center m-auto py-4">
            <img class="w-75" src="https://img.funnelish.com/15696/294304/1709143130-dog%20114.svg"/>
        </div>
        <div class="py-4">
            <p>
                And the worst thing was…
                <br/><br/>
                They felt guilty and didn’t know what to do.
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="font-weight-bold">I knew I had to help.</span>
                <br/><br/>
                At first, I assumed Marco's issue was caused by ticks or other bugs that wake up after winter.
                <br/><br/>
                But I was wrong.
                <br/><br/>
                Despite the family’s lack of knowledge of dogs, they always took good care of Marco.
                <br/><br/>
                They brushed his fur regularly…
                <br/><br/>
                They washed him at least once a month, even through winter…
                <br/><br/>
                And they were giving him dietary supplements to support his bone & joint health – a problem that many German Shepherds face.
                <br/><br/>
                Yet, nothing seemed to work.
                <br/><br/>
                Marco was no longer playful…
                <br/><br/>
                He was barely eating…
                <br/><br/>
                And his fur had become patchy and his skin was covered with red welts.
                <br/><br/>
                Then one day, I received a frightening phone call…

                <p class="pb-3">They were on their way to the hospital, and the family was frightened.

                <p class="pb-3">Richard felt guilty for letting the situation get so worse.

        </div>
        <div ><h3 class=" text-center m-auto pb-3">I shared the story with my wife, and she was devastated.</div>
        <div class="py-4">
            <p>
                As a lifelong dog lover, she knew that Marco wasn't a dangerous dog, who could turn on the family.
                <br/><br/>
                The constant pain and discomfort had pushed Marco to his breaking point…
                <br/><br/>
                He was just trying to protect himself from the pain.
                <br/><br/>
                My wife couldn't shake the feeling that there had to be a solution out there that could help Marco.
                <br/><br/>
                Determined to find answers, my wife dove into research, tirelessly combing through the internet for any shred of hope.
                <br/><br/>
                But all she could find were the same old solutions that Marco's family had already tried…

                <br/><br/>
                And sticky “anti-itch” sprays.
                <br/><br/>
                It seemed like we had reached a dead end.
                <br/><br/>
                However, my wife refused to give up.
                <br/><br/>
                She began to wonder what had triggered Marco's excessive itching and scratching.
                <br/><br/>
                After all, he had been perfectly fine just a few weeks before.
                <br/><br/>
                Eager to get to the bottom of this mystery, she consulted a trusted veterinarian she’s worked together with in the past.
                <br/><br/>
                She revealed that many dog owners come to her in the spring, complaining of similar issues caused by seasonal allergies.
                <br/><br/>
                It turns out that a significant number of dogs suffer from allergies in the spring.
                <br/><br/>
                <span class="font-weight-bold med-text">In fact, 1 in 5 dogs suffers from allergies, most of which their owners don’t even know about.</span>

                It might seem cute when your pup asks you to rub its belly and they scratch their leg simultaneously with your hand…
                <br/><br/>
                However, this actually could be a sign of how irritated and uncomfortable your dog is feeling.
                <br/><br/>
                Let me explain.
                <br/><br/>
                As you already know – dogs, just like humans, can suffer from seasonal allergies.
                <br/><br/>
                Hence why you often notice your dog itching more once spring comes.
                <br/><br/>
                These allergies are usually caused by pollen from trees, grasses, weeds, mold spores, and many other environmental factors that are more prevalent during the spring and summer months.
            </p>

        <div class="text-center m-auto">

        </div>
        <div>
            <p class="py-5">
                And if you’ve noticed your dog itching & scratching…
                <br/><br/>
                Licking or biting their paws…
                <br/><br/>
                Or their eyes get red & watery…
                <br/><br/>
                It’s very likely that your dog is suffering from allergies.

                <div class="col-12 col-md-6"><p>
                    When your dog is exposed to these allergens, their body reacts by producing an antibody called immunoglobulin E (IgE).
                    <br/><br/>
                    IgE triggers the release of histamine and other chemicals in the body.
                    <br/><br/>
                    On one hand, this is good…
                    <br/><br/>
                    These chemicals cause your dog’s blood vessels to widen and become more permeable.
                    <br/><br/>
                    This allows white blood cells and other immune cells to migrate to the site of an injury or infection, where they can fight off any foreign invaders.
                    <br/><br/>
                    But on the other hand…
                </p></div>
                <div class="col-12 col-md-6"><img class="img-fluid" src="https://img.funnelish.com/15696/294304/1709137923-immunoglobulin%20E.jpeg" /></div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Histamine can also trigger allergy symptoms such as itching, swelling, and inflammation when the immune system overreacts to harmless substances like pollen.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In simple terms, this causes the excessive itching & scratching your dog is suffering from.
                    <br/><br/>
                    But there’s one problem though…
                    <br/><br/>
                    Seasonal allergies in dogs don't just disappear once spring is over.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The allergens that trigger the reaction can continue to be present in the environment for an extended period.
                    <br/><br/>
                    For example, grass and weed pollen persist well into the summer and fall months.
                    <br/><br/>
                    But it gets worse…
                    <br/><br/>
                    Repeated exposure to allergens can cause the immune system to become sensitized…
                    <br/><br/>
                    Meaning that the body overreacts to even small amounts of the allergen.
                    <br/><br/>
                    This can lead to long-term allergy symptoms that persist even after the initial trigger has been removed…
                    <br/><br/>
                    Leaving your dog itching & scratching themselves raw without a break…
                    <br/><br/>
                    Which can lead to even more problems…
                    <br/><br/>
                    Like developing secondary bacterial or yeast infections due to their weakened immune system and constant scratching and itching.

                    Feeling embarrassed when your guests see the condition of your dog…
                    <br/><br/>
                    And not being able to pet them and love them cause you’re afraid to catch something yourself.
                    <br/><br/>

                <h2>Knowing this, my wife couldn’t just wait for Marco's allergies to subside.</h2>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Marco was suffering, and his entire family was now afraid to come close to him.
                    <br/><br/>
                    With Marco being only 9 months old, my wife was determined to find a safe and effective solution for a young dog.
                    <br/><br/>
                    That's when she stumbled upon a miraculous "newborn nectar" that could be the key to finding the relief Marco so desperately needed.
                    <br/><br/>
                    And as you’ll see, it wasn't just a turning point for Marco, but also for countless other dogs and their loving owners.
                    <br/><br/>
                    It’s so effective because instead of just addressing the symptoms, like other remedies out there…
                    <br/><br/>
                    This Newborn Nectar targets the root cause of dogs’ excessive itching & scratching by ‘resetting’ their immune system.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Here’s how:
                    <br/><br/>
                    The scientific name of this “Newborn Nectar” is Colostrum.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="text-center m-auto py-5">
                <img class="img-fluid" src="https://img.funnelish.com/15696/294304/1709143487-dog-6.svg" />
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Colostrum is also often referred to as the "first mother's milk".
                    <br/><br/>
                    It’s because it's the first milk produced by mom-dogs after giving birth. (usually within the first 24-48 hours after delivery)
                    <br/><br/>
                    And it is very different in composition from the milk that is produced later on.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Colostrum contains high levels of immunoglobulins and other important nutrients that provide essential support to newborn puppies, helping them to establish a strong immune system and stay healthy.
                    <br/><br/>
                    But it’s not just newborn puppies it can help…
                    <br/><br/>
                    It can help dogs of any age, size, or breed.

                        <br/><br/>
                        One of the ways colostrum can help relieve itching and scratching in dogs is by modulating their weak immune system, making it as strong as it once was, almost as if it ‘resets’ it.
                        <br/><br/>
                        It contains immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, and IgM) that can bind to harmful substances like bacteria, viruses, and allergens, and neutralize them.
                        <br/><br/>
                        This can help reduce inflammation and other immune-related reactions that cause itching and scratching.

                        <br/><br/>
                        Colostrum also contains growth factors like insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) that can promote tissue repair and regeneration.
                        <br/><br/>
                        This means that if the itching and scratching have caused skin damage, colostrum can help speed up the healing process and reduce the likelihood of infection.

                        <br/><br/>
                        Furthermore, colostrum contains bioactive peptides like lactoferrin and proline-rich polypeptides (PRPs) that have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects.
                        <br/><br/>
                        They can help regulate the immune system and reduce allergic reactions, which is the #1 cause of itching and scratching in dogs.

            Colostrum could be the missing key to finally relieving Marco’s agonizing itching & scratching.
            <br/><br/>
            It could help boost Marco’s immune system, so his body can fight against allergic reactions…
            <br/><br/>
            Promote tissue repair, so his wound could finally heal to restore his shiny fur…
            <br/><br/>
            And colostrum could reduce inflammation and allergic reactions, meaning Marco’s condition wouldn’t get any worse than it already is.
            <br/><br/>
            But there was only one way to find out…

                <div class="col-12 col-md-6"><p>
                    So I rang Richard to tell him the news.
                    <br/><br/>
                    At first, he wasn’t too excited.
                    <br/><br/>
                    After all, he’s tried countless times to relieve Marco’s terrible condition but never succeeded.
                    <br/><br/>
                    But he didn’t have a better option…
                    <br/><br/>
                    The kids were afraid to come too close to Marco…
                    <br/><br/>
                    Richard was hesitant to give him yet another oatmeal bath, as he could accidentally brush one of Marco’s red spots…
                    <br/><br/>
                    And the “anti-itch” sprays only made Marco’s fur seem more greasy & sticky than it already was.
                    <br/><br/>
                    So Richard took my advice.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The day I received the delivery of colostrum, I immediately went over to Richard’s place.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Since Marco often refused to eat due to the discomfort caused by his itching…
                    <br/><br/>
                    I also brought some chicken breasts to ensure he would consume the colostrum-laced meals.

            <div>
                <p>
                    The next day, I called Richard hopeful to see if Marco's itching and scratching had improved.
                    <br/><br/>
                    But the answer I received wasn't what I had hoped for…

            My wife and I felt defeated.
            <br/><br/>
            <span class="font-weight-bold">We believed this would finally put an end to Marco’s suffering.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            Despite the disappointment, we urged Richard to keep feeding Marco colostrum until the supply ends.
            <br/><br/>
            They had nothing to lose.
            <br/><br/>
            They had already tried everything else, but nothing seemed to work.
            <br/><br/>
            And after a week, I received a phone call from Richard…
